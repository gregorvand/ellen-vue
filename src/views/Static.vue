      anonymised before Ellen receives it, and Ellen has no ability to identify
      the customers. You also agree not to use this data in conjunction with
      other data sources to attempt to identify PII of any customer from our

      company use is not permitted. A screenshot of a chart used in a
      presentation or on a website must include the ‘ELLEN’ watermark present on
      every chart on the platform. Attempts to remove the watermark will be
      regarded as breach of service terms. If data is presented in text form, or
      only part of a chart is to be shown, a source/credit must be visible close
      to the information, including the words ‘Ellen Inc.’

      subscription from your dashboard before it renews in order to avoid
      billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will

      during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your
      payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing
      your account settings at:

      <a></a>16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
    </h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify">16.1 Generally</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Ellen in the most
      expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section
      16.2, you and Ellen agree that every dispute arising in connection with
      these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less
      formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
      instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in
      court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
      can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This
      agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or
      relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort,
      statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
      regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of
      these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS,
      YOU AND Ellen ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
      PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.2 Exceptions</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be
      deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party
      to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an
      enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency
      if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law
      in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an
      intellectual property infringement claim.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.3 Arbitrator</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Any arbitration between you and Ellen will be settled under the Federal
      Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association
      (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”)
      as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available
      online at
      <a
        href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adr.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1644306574563821&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iiMZl0MCBm1gphvW_G5OQ"
        target="_blank"
        >www.adr.org</a
      >, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Ellen. The
      arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
      interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding
      arbitration agreement.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
      of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal
      Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided
      a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of
      Arbitration”). Ellen’s address for Notice is: Ellen, Inc., 2443 Fillmore
      Street #380-7163, San Francisco, CA 94115. The Notice of Arbitration must:
      (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set
      forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good
      faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not
      reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration
      is received, you or Ellen may commence an arbitration proceeding. During
      the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ellen
      must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
      final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved
      through arbitration in your favor, Ellen will pay you the highest of the
      following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last
      written settlement amount offered by Ellen in settlement of the dispute
      prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $10,000.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.5 Fees</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Ellen will
      reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for
      more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided
      by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to
      be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for
      $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted:
      (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b)
      through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person
      hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your
      billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
      claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
      improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
      of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed
      by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Ellen for all
      monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to
      pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
      is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
      sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
      decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and
      resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses
      at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
      within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.6 No Class Actions</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      YOU AND Ellen AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
      YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
      ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you
      and Ellen agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
      one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
      representative or class proceeding.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      16.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If Ellen makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than
      a change to Ellen’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the
      change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
      Ellen’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with
      Ellen will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
      effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">16.8 Enforceability</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If Section 16.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this
      Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section
      16 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the
      exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.1 will govern any
      action arising out of or related to these Terms.

      any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any

      any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms
      the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If
      any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
      unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible,
      and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
